  <article class="About-Me">
    <p>Originating from Venezuela, I arrived two years ago with an insatiable drive to learn and a bare-bones grasp of the English language, which I've since cultivated into a proficient level through relentless dedication. My journey stems from a deep passion for economics, self-taught and fueled by an unwavering fascination with global markets. 
    Transitioning into the realm of sales, I cultivated essential communication skills and mastered the art of negotiation. As I ventured into managerial roles, I discovered an innate leadership ability, emphasizing a fusion of discipline and innovative strategies. Beyond the professional sphere, I prioritize fitness, dedicating myself to workouts and running for a balanced lifestyle.
    From my earliest memories, I've been engrossed in unraveling the inner workings of computers and the complexities of operating systems like Windows and Mac. Currently embarking on a new season as a coding student, I aim to replicate the same passion and dedication that propelled my language learning journey into mastering the world of coding.</p>
